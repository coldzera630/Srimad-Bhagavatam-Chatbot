He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal.

I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.", "explanation_text": "Purport\nObeisances unto the Personality of Godhead Vāsudeva directly indicate Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devakī. This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. Śrī Vyāsadeva asserts herein that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his\nKṛṣṇa-sandarbha.\nAnd Brahmā, the original living being, has explained the subject of Śrī Kṛṣṇa substantially in his treatise named\nBrahma-saṁhitā.\nIn an\nUpaniṣad\nin the\nSāma-veda,\nit is also stated that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the divine son of Devakī. Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word Kṛṣṇa, which means the all-attractive. In\nBhagavad-gītā,\nin many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like Nārada, Vyāsa, and many others. In the\nPadma Purāṇa,\nit is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of Kṛṣṇa is the principal one. Vāsudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with Vāsudeva, are indicated in this text. The name Vāsudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devakī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is always meditated upon by the\nparamahaṁsas,\nwho are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life.\nVāsudeva, or Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the cause of all causes. Everything that exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mahāprabhu Śrī Caitanya as the spotless\nPurāṇa\nbecause it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The history of the\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis also very glorious. It was compiled by Śrī Vyāsadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of Śrī Nāradajī, his spiritual master. Vyāsadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the\nVedas,\nthe\nVedānta-sūtras\n(or the\nBrahma-sūtras\n), the\nPurāṇas,\nthe\nMahābhārata,\nand so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus Nārada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories.\nIt is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\ngives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will. Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead.\nIn Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahmā, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings. And above Brahmā, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings. But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties. If a man’s brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. Śrīla Vyāsadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the\nparameśvara.\nHe offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the\npara\nor the\nparameśvara\nor the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that\nparameśvara\nis Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as admitted in\nBhagavad-gītā\nand other scriptures delivered by Śrī Vyāsadeva and specifically in this\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nIn\nBhagavad-gītā,\nthe Lord says that there is no other\npara-tattva\n(\nsummum bonum\n) than Himself. Therefore, Śrī Vyāsadeva at once worships the\npara-tattva,\nŚrī Kṛṣṇa, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.\nUnscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto and especially to the five chapters which describe the Lord’s\nrāsa\ndance. This portion of the\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis the most confidential part of this great literature. Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord’s worshipable transcendental pastimes called\nrāsa\ndance and His love affairs with the\ngopīs.\nThis subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have gradually attained to the stage of\nparamahaṁsa\ncan transcendentally relish this\nrāsa\ndance. Śrīla Vyāsadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a Gāyatrī\nmantra, dhīmahi.\nThis Gāyatrī\nmantra\nis meant for spiritually advanced people. When one is successful in chanting the Gāyatrī\nmantra,\nhe can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must therefore acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of goodness in order to chant the Gāyatrī\nmantra\nsuccessfully and then attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord, His name, His fame, His qualities and so on.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis the narration of the\nsvarūpa\nof the Lord manifested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from the external potency which has manifested the cosmic world, which is within our experience. Śrīla Vyāsadeva makes a clear distinction between the two in this\nśloka.\nŚrī Vyāsadeva says herein that the manifested internal potency is real, whereas the external manifested energy in the form of material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the desert. In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahmā, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia.\nThe chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner because everything is done under his direction. He knows everything about the construction, both directly and indirectly. Similarly, the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation, knows every nook and corner, although affairs are being carried out by demigods. Beginning from Brahmā down to the insignificant ant, no one is independent in the material creation. The hand of the Lord is seen everywhere. All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate from Him only. And whatever is created in this material world is but the interaction of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. But, in reality, the living entity works in the laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord. And the materials with which he works are also supplied by the Lord. The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details, and He is fully independent. He is compared to a mine of gold, and the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared to objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on. The gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different. Nothing is absolutely equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent of the Absolute Truth.\nConditioned souls, beginning from Brahmā, who engineers the entire universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them is independent of the Supreme Lord. The materialist wrongly thinks that there is no creator other than his own self. This is called\nmāyā,\nor illusion. Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence. This is refuted in this\nśloka\nby Śrīla Vyāsadeva: “Since the complete whole or the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, nothing can be independent of the body of the Absolute Truth.” Whatever happens to the body quickly becomes known to the embodied. Similarly, the creation is the body of the absolute whole. Therefore, the Absolute knows everything directly and indirectly that happens in the creation.\nIn the\nśruti-mantra,\nit is also stated that the absolute whole or Brahman is the ultimate source of everything. Everything emanates from Him, and everything is maintained by Him. And at the end, everything enters into Him. That is the law of nature. In the\nsmṛti-mantra,\nthe same is confirmed. It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahmā’s millennium, and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth, or Brahman. Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate source is explained. According to the Vedic literatures, Brahmā, who may be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator. It is stated in this\nśloka\nthat Brahmā was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead. One may argue that Brahmā, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time. Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahmā, in order that Brahmā could carry out his creative functions. So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In\nBhagavad-gītā,\nLord Śrī Kṛṣṇa states that it is He only who superintends the creative energy,\nprakṛti,\nwhich constitutes the totality of matter. Therefore, Śrī Vyāsadeva does not worship Brahmā, but the Supreme Lord, who guides Brahmā in his creative activities. In this\nśloka,\nthe particular words\nabhijñaḥ\nand\nsvarāṭ\nare significant. These two words distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities. No other living entity is either\nabhijñaḥ\nor\nsvarāṭ.\nThat is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahmā has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even Māyāvādī impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord are neither\nabhijñaḥ\nnor\nsvarāṭ.\nSuch impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like Rāvaṇa or Hiraṇyakaśipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them. This is confirmed in\nBhagavad-gītā\n(\nBg. 4.7\n) in the well-known verse\nyadā yadā hi dharmasya glāniḥ.\n“Whenever there is a decline of\ndharma\nand a rise of\nadharma,\nO Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself.”\nThat the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all\nśruti-mantras.\nIt is said in the\nśruti-mantras\nthat the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over matter and thus created all living beings. The living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to enact so many wonderful creations. An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God’s further attention. If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God. But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually. Therefore, no one can create as well as God. Another name for God is\nasamordhva,\nwhich means that no one is equal to or greater than Him.\nParaṁ satyam,\nor the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior. This is confirmed in the\nśruti-mantras.\nIt is said that before the creation of the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of everyone. That Lord instructed Brahmā in Vedic knowledge. That Lord has to be obeyed in all respects. Anyone who wants to get rid of the material entanglement must surrender unto Him. This is also confirmed in\nBhagavad-gītā.\nUnless one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, it is certain that he will be bewildered. When an intelligent man surrenders unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and knows completely that Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes, as confirmed in\nBhagavad-gītā,\nthen only can such an intelligent man become a\nmahātmā,\nor great soul. But such a great soul is rarely seen. Only the\nmahātmās\ncan understand that the Supreme Lord is the primeval cause of all creations. He is\nparama\nor ultimate truth because all other truths are relative to Him. He is omniscient. For Him, there is no illusion.\nSome Māyāvādī scholars argue that\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nwas not compiled by Śrī Vyāsadeva. And some of them suggest that this book is a modern creation written by someone named Vopadeva. In order to refute such meaningless arguments, Śrī Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that there is reference to the\nBhāgavatam\nin many of the oldest\nPurāṇas.\nThis first\nśloka\nof the\nBhāgavatam\nbegins with the Gāyatrī\nmantra.\nThere is reference to this in the\nMatsya Purāṇa,\nwhich is the oldest\nPurāṇa.\nIn that\nPurāṇa,\nit is said with reference to the Gāyatrī\nmantra\nin the\nBhāgavatam\nthat there are many narrations of spiritual instructions beginning with the Gāyatrī\nmantra.\nAnd there is the history of Vṛtrāsura. Anyone who makes a gift of this great work on a full moon day attains to the highest perfection of life by returning to Godhead. There is reference to the\nBhāgavatam\nin other\nPurāṇas\nalso, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished in twelve cantos, which include eighteen thousand\nślokas.\nIn the\nPadma Purāṇa\nalso there is reference to the\nBhāgavatam\nin a conversation between Gautama and Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. The king was advised therein to read regularly\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nif he desired liberation from material bondage. Under the circumstances, there is no doubt about the authority of the\nBhāgavatam.\nWithin the past five hundred years, many erudite scholars and\nācāryas\nlike Jīva Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Vallabhācārya, and many other distinguished scholars even after the time of Lord Caitanya made elaborate commentaries on the\nBhāgavatam.\nAnd the serious student would do well to attempt to go through them to better relish the transcendental messages.\nŚrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura specifically deals with the original and pure sex psychology (\nādi-rasa\n), devoid of all mundane inebriety.\nThe whole material creation is moving under the principle of sex life.\nIn modern civilization, sex life is the focal point for all activities. Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal. It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life.\nThis\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nwill gradually elevate the unbiased reader to the highest perfectional stage of transcendence. It will enable him to transcend the three modes of material activities: fruitive actions, speculative philosophy, and worship of functional deities as inculcated in Vedic verses."}

The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bhāgavatam, compiled by the great sage Vyāsadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bhāgavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.", "explanation_text": "Purport\nReligion includes four primary subjects, namely pious activities, economic development, satisfaction of the senses, and finally liberation from material bondage. Irreligious life is a barbarous condition. Indeed, human life begins when religion begins. Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating are the four principles of animal life. These are common both to animals and to human beings. But religion is the extra function of the human being. Without religion, human life is no better than animal life. Therefore, in human societies there is some form of religion which aims at self-realization and which makes reference to man’s eternal relationship with God.\nIn the lower stages of human civilization, there is always competition to lord it over the material nature or, in other words, there is a continuous rivalry to satisfy the senses. Driven by such consciousness, man turns to religion. He thus performs pious activities or religious functions in order to gain something material. But if such material gains are obtainable in other ways, then so-called religion is neglected. This is the situation in modern civilization. Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not very interested in religion. Churches, mosques or temples are now practically vacant. Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in religious places which were erected by their forefathers. This practically proves that religion is performed for some economic gains. Economic gains are needed for sense gratification. Often when one is baffled in the pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become one with the Supreme Lord. Consequently, all these states are simply different types of sense gratification.\nIn the\nVedas,\nthe above-mentioned four activities are prescribed in the regulative way so that there will not be any undue competition for sense gratification. But\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis transcendental to all these sense gratificatory activities. It is purely transcendental literature which can be understood only by the pure devotees of the Lord who are transcendental to competitive sense gratification. In the material world there is keen competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and community, nation and nation. But the devotees of the Lord rise above such competitions. They do not compete with the materialist because they are on the path back to Godhead where life is eternal and blissful. Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart. In the material world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is competition. But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only free from material envy, but are well-wishers to everyone, and they strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center. The contemporary socialist’s conception of a competitionless society is artificial because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator. From the point of view of the\nVedas\nor from the point of view of common human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life. There are three paths mentioned in the\nVedas.\nOne involves fruitive activities to gain promotion to better planets. Another involves worshiping different demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and becoming one with Him.\nThe impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth is not the highest. Above the impersonal feature is the Paramātmā feature, and above this is the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, or Bhagavān.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\ngives information about the Absolute Truth in His personal feature. It is higher than impersonalist literatures and higher than the\njñāna-kāṇḍa\ndivision of the\nVedas.\nIt is even higher than the\nkarma-kāṇḍa\ndivision, and even higher than the\nupāsanā-kāṇḍa\ndivision, because it recommends the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In the\nkarma-kāṇḍa,\nthere is competition to reach heavenly planets for better sense gratification, and there is similar competition in the\njñāna-kāṇḍa\nand the\nupāsanā-kāṇḍa.\nThe\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis superior to all of these because it aims at the Supreme Truth, which is the substance or the root of all categories. From\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\none can come to know the substance as well as the categories. The substance is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, and all emanations are relative forms of energy.\nNothing is apart from the substance, but at the same time the energies are different from the substance. This conception is not contradictory.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nexplicitly promulgates this simultaneously-one-and-different philosophy of the\nVedānta-sūtra,\nwhich begins with the “\njanmādy asya\n”\nsūtra.\nThis knowledge that the energy of the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators’ attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute. When this knowledge is factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to be imperfect. Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded in the conception of simultaneously-one-and-different leads one immediately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are (1) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, (2) those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and (3) those miseries arising from natural catastrophes over which one has no control.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nbegins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute Person. The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute. In the material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys, and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life. But as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant, he at once becomes free from all miseries. As long as the living entity is trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming servant of the Supreme. Service to the Lord is rendered in pure consciousness of one’s spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from material encumbrances.\nOver and above this,\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis a personal commentation on the\nVedānta-sūtra\nby Śrī Vyāsadeva. It was written in the maturity of his spiritual life through the mercy of Nārada. Śrī Vyāsadeva is the authorized incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there is no question as to his authority. He is the author of all other Vedic literatures, yet he recommends the study of\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nabove all others. In other\nPurāṇas\nthere are different methods set forth by which one can worship the demigods. But in the\nBhāgavatam\nonly the Supreme Lord is mentioned. The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the different parts of that body. Consequently, by worshiping the Supreme Lord, one does not need to worship the demigods. The Supreme Lord becomes fixed in the heart of the devotee immediately. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended the\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nas the spotless\nPurāṇa\nand distinguishes it from all other\nPurāṇas.\nThe proper method for receiving this transcendental message is to hear it submissively. A challenging attitude cannot help one realize this transcendental message. One particular word is used herein for proper guidance. This word is\nśuśrūṣu.\nOne must be anxious to hear this transcendental message. The desire to sincerely hear is the first qualification.\nLess fortunate persons are not at all interested in hearing this\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nThe process is simple, but the application is difficult. Unfortunate people find enough time to hear idle social and political conversations, but when invited to attend a meeting of devotees to hear\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nthey suddenly become reluctant. Sometimes professional readers of the\nBhāgavatam\nimmediately plunge into the confidential topics of the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, which they seemingly interpret as sex literature.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis meant to be heard from the beginning. Those who are fit to assimilate this work are mentioned in this\nśloka:\n“One becomes qualified to hear\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nafter many pious deeds.” The intelligent person, with thoughtful discretion, can be assured by the great sage Vyāsadeva that he can realize the Supreme Personality directly by hearing\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nWithout undergoing the different stages of realization set forth in the\nVedas,\none can be lifted immediately to the position of\nparamahaṁsa\nsimply by agreeing to receive this message."}

Regulative knowledge involves a gradual raising of the living entity to the spiritual platform, and the highest spiritual realization is knowledge that the Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all spiritual tastes, or\nrasas.\nEvery living entity, beginning from Brahmā, the first-born living being within the material world, down to the insignificant ant, desires to relish some sort of taste derived from sense perceptions. These sensual pleasures are technically called\nrasas.\nSuch\nrasas\nare of different varieties. In the revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of\nrasas\nare enumerated: (1)\nraudra\n(anger), (2)\nadbhuta\n(wonder), (3)\nśṛṅgāra\n(conjugal love), (4)\nhāsya\n(comedy), (5)\nvīra\n(chivalry), (6)\ndayā\n(mercy), (7)\ndāsya\n(servitorship), (8)\nsakhya\n(fraternity), (9)\nbhayānaka\n(horror), (10)\nbībhatsa\n(shock), (11)\nśānta\n(neutrality), (12)\nvātsalya\n(parenthood).\nThe sum total of all these\nrasas\nis called affection or love. Primarily, such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, parental affection, and conjugal love. And when these five are absent, love is present indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on. For example, when a man is in love with a woman, the\nrasa\nis called conjugal love. But when such love affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger, shock, or even horror. Sometimes love affairs between two persons culminate in ghastly murder scenes. Such\nrasas\nare displayed between man and man and between animal and animal. There is no possibility of an exchange or\nrasa\nbetween a man and an animal or between a man and any other species of living beings within the material world. The\nrasas\nare exchanged between members of the same species. But as far as the spirit souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the\nrasas\nwere originally exchanged between the spiritual living being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual exchange or\nrasa\nis fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord.\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the\nśruti-mantras,\nVedic hymns, as “the fountainhead of all\nrasas.\n” When one associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one’s constitutional\nrasa\nwith the Lord, then the living being is actually happy.\nThese\nśruti-mantras\nindicate that every living being has its constitutional position, which is endowed with a particular type of\nrasa\nto be exchanged with the Personality of Godhead. In the liberated condition only, this primary\nrasa\nis experienced in full. In the material existence, the\nrasa\nis experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary. And thus the\nrasas\nof the material world are exhibited in the material form of\nraudra\n(anger) and so on.\nTherefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different\nrasas,\nwhich are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false representations of the original\nrasas\nwhich are reflected in the material world. The learned scholar seeks to relish the real\nrasa\nin the spiritual form. In the beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme. Thus, less intelligent transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different\nrasas.\nIn this\nśloka,\nit is definitely stated that spiritual\nrasa,\nwhich is relished even in the liberated stage, can be experienced in the literature of the\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\ndue to its being the ripened fruit of all Vedic knowledge. By submissively hearing this transcendental literature, one can attain the full pleasure of his heart’s desire. But one must be very careful to hear the message from the right source.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis exactly received from the right source. It was brought by Nārada Muni from the spiritual world and given to his disciple Śrī Vyāsadeva. The latter in turn delivered the message to his son Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, and Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī delivered the message to Mahārāja Parīkṣit just seven days before the King’s death. Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī was a liberated soul from his very birth. He was liberated even in the womb of his mother, and he did not undergo any sort of spiritual training after his birth. At birth no one is qualified, neither in the mundane nor in the spiritual sense. But Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī, due to his being a perfectly liberated soul, did not have to undergo an evolutionary process for spiritual realization. Yet despite his being a completely liberated person situated in the transcendental position above the three material modes, he was attracted to this transcendental\nrasa\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is adored by liberated souls who sing Vedic hymns. The Supreme Lord’s pastimes are more attractive to liberated souls than to mundane people. He is of necessity not impersonal because it is only possible to carry on transcendental\nrasa\nwith a person.\nIn the\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nthe transcendental pastimes of the Lord are narrated, and the narration is systematically depicted by Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Thus the subject matter is appealing to all classes of persons, including those who seek liberation and those who seek to become one with the supreme whole.\nIn Sanskrit the parrot is also known as\nśuka.\nWhen a ripened fruit is cut by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced. The Vedic fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability to recite the\nBhāgavatam\nexactly as he heard it from his learned father, but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to all classes of men.\nThe subject matter is so presented through the lips of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī that any sincere listener that hears submissively can at once relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes of the material world. The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from the highest planet of Kṛṣṇaloka. Rather, it has come down carefully through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance. Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental\nrasa\nknown as the\nrāsa\ndance without following in the footsteps of Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcendental realization. One should be intelligent enough to know the position of\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nby considering personalities like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who deals with the subject so carefully. This process of disciplic succession of the\nBhāgavata\nschool suggests that in the future also\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nhas to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī. A professional man who makes a business out of reciting the\nBhāgavatam\nillegally is certainly not a representative of Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Such a man’s business is only to earn his livelihood. Therefore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men. Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject. They usually plunge into the subject matter of the\nrāsa\ndance, which is misunderstood by the foolish class of men. Some of them take this to be immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpretations. They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī.\nOne should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of the\nrasa\nshould receive the message of\nBhāgavatam\nin the chain of disciplic succession from Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who describes the\nBhāgavatam\nfrom its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has very little knowledge in transcendental science.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis so carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice through the mouth of Śukadeva Gosvāmī or his bona fide representative."}

The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place known as Naimiṣāraṇya. Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of Naimiṣāraṇya in the\nVarāha Purāṇa,\nwhere it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed. Thus\nbrāhmaṇas\nprefer Naimiṣāraṇya for such sacrificial performances.\nThe devotees of Lord Viṣṇu offer all kinds of sacrifices for His pleasure. The devotees are always attached to the service of the Lord, whereas fallen souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence. In\nBhagavad-gītā,\nit is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason other than for the pleasure of Lord Viṣṇu causes further bondage for the performer. It is enjoined therefore that all acts must be performed sacrificially for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu and His devotees. This will bring everyone peace and prosperity.\nThe great sages are always anxious to do good to the people in general, and as such the sages headed by Śaunaka and others assembled at this holy place of Naimiṣāraṇya with a program of performing a great and continuous chain of sacrificial ceremonies. Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and prosperity. However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living entities, and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people. Lord Viṣṇu is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men, Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Vidyādharas and other living entities, are like branches, twigs and leaves of that tree. By pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarly, human society, when it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources.\nThe modern materialistic society is detached from its relation to the Supreme Lord. And all its plans which are being made by atheistic leaders are sure to be baffled at every step. Yet they do not wake up to this.\nIn this age, the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the prescribed method for waking up. The ways and means are most scientifically presented by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and intelligent persons may take advantage of His teachings in order to bring about real peace and prosperity.\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nis also presented for the same purpose, and this will be explained more specifically later in the text."}

A representative is one who can exactly present the viewpoint of Śrī Vyāsadeva. Śrī Vyāsadeva impregnated the message of\nBhāgavatam\nunto Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, and Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī heard it from him (Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī).

When the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya analyzed the state of affairs of the people in this Age of Kali, they foresaw that men would live short lives. In Kali-yuga, the duration of life is shortened not so much because of insufficient food but because of irregular habits. By keeping regular habits and eating simple food, any man can maintain his health. Overeating, over-sense gratification, overdependence on another’s mercy, and artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of human energy. Therefore the duration of life is shortened.\nThe people of this age are also very lazy, not only materially but in the matter of self-realization. The human life is especially meant for self-realization. That is to say, man should come to know what he is, what the world is, and what the supreme truth is. Human life is a means by which the living entity can end all the miseries of the hard struggle for life in material existence and by which he can return to Godhead, his eternal home. But, due to a bad system of education, men have no desire for self-realization. Even if they come to know about it, they unfortunately become victims of misguided teachers.\nIn this age, men are victims not only of different political creeds and parties, but also of many different types of sense gratificatory diversions, such as cinemas, sports, gambling, clubs, mundane libraries, bad association, smoking, drinking, cheating, pilfering, bickerings and so on. Their minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements. In this age, many unscrupulous men manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions. Consequently, in the name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of mind nor health of body. The student (\nbrahmacārī\n) communities are no longer being maintained, and householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the\ngṛhastha-āśrama.\nConsequently, the so-called\nvānaprasthas\nand\nsannyāsīs\nwho come out of such\ngṛhastha-āśramas\nare easily deviated from the rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness. Men are no longer interested in spiritual values. Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the maintenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations and communities, and there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups. It has become very difficult, therefore, to raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society. The sages of Naimiṣāraṇya are anxious to disentangle all fallen souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī."}

Taking into consideration the fallen condition of the people in general in this Age of Kali, the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya suggested that Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī relate the essence of all such scriptures because in this age it is not possible for the fallen souls to understand and undergo all the lessons of all these various scriptures in a\nvarṇa\nand\nāśrama\nsystem.\nThe\nvarṇa\nand\nāśrama\nsociety was considered to be the best institution for lifting the human being to the spiritual platform, but due to Kali-yuga it is not possible to execute the rules and regulations of these institutions.

Anyone, therefore, can take advantage of the holy names of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa even in the midst of the greatest dangers. The transcendental name of Kṛṣṇa, even though uttered unconsciously or by force of circumstances, can help one obtain freedom from the hurdle of birth and death."}

One can derive spiritual benefit out of prolonged use of the Ganges waters. But one can be sanctified at once by the mercy of a pure devotee of the Lord. In\nBhagavad-gītā\nit is said that any person, regardless of birth as\nśūdra,\nwoman, or merchant, can take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and by so doing can return to Godhead. To take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to take shelter of the pure devotees. The pure devotees whose only business is serving are honored by the names Prabhupāda and Viṣṇupāda, which indicate such devotees to be representatives of the lotus feet of the Lord. Anyone, therefore, who takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual master can be at once purified. Such devotees of the Lord are honored equally with the Lord because they are engaged in the most confidential service of the Lord, for they deliver out of the material world the fallen souls whom the Lord wants to return home, back to Godhead. Such pure devotees are better known as vice-lords according to revealed scriptures. The sincere disciple of the pure devotee considers the spiritual master equal to the Lord, but always considers himself to be a humble servant of the servant of the Lord. This is the pure devotional path."}

Kali-yuga is so saturated with vicious habits that there is a great fight at the slightest misunderstanding. Those who are engaged in the pure devotional service of the Lord, who are without any desire for self-aggrandizement and who are freed from the effects of fruitive actions and dry philosophical speculations are capable of getting out of the estrangements of this complicated age. The leaders of the people are very much anxious to live in peace and friendship, but they have no information of the simple method of hearing the glories of the Lord. On the contrary, such leaders are opposed to the propagation of the glories of the Lord. In other words, the foolish leaders want to completely deny the existence of the Lord. In the name of secular state, such leaders are enacting various plans every year. But by the insurmountable intricacies of the material nature of the Lord, all these plans for progress are being constantly frustrated. They have no eyes to see that their attempts at peace and friendship are failing. But here is the hint to get over the hurdle. If we want actual peace, we must open the road to understanding of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa and glorify Him for His virtuous activities as they are depicted in the pages of\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam."}

Please, therefore, speak to us, who are eager to hear, about the adventures He performs in His various incarnations.", "explanation_text": "Purport\nThe Personality of Godhead is never inactive as some less intelligent persons suggest. His works are magnificent and magnanimous. His creations both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all variegatedness. They are described nicely by such liberated souls as Śrīla Nārada, Vyāsa, Vālmīki, Devala, Asita, Madhva, Śrī Caitanya, Rāmānuja, Viṣṇusvāmī, Nimbārka, Śrīdhara, Viśvanātha, Baladeva, Bhaktivinoda, Siddhānta Sarasvatī and many other learned and self-realized souls. These creations, both material and spiritual, are full of opulence, beauty and knowledge, but the spiritual realm is more magnificent due to its being full of knowledge, bliss and eternity. The material creations are manifested for some time as perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas. They attract people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false things. Such foolish men have no information of the reality, and they take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all. But more intelligent men guided by sages like Vyāsa and Nārada know that the eternal kingdom of God is more delightful, larger, and eternally full of bliss and knowledge. Those who are not conversant with the activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored by the Lord in His adventures as incarnations wherein He displays the eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm. By such activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world. Some of these conditioned souls are engaged in the false enjoyment of material senses and others in simply negating their real life in the spiritual world. These less intelligent persons are known as\nkarmīs,\nor fruitive workers, and\njñānīs,\nor dry mental speculators. But above these two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as\nsātvata,\nor the devotee, who is busy neither with rampant material activity nor with material speculation. He is engaged in the positive service of the Lord, and thereby he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the\nkarmīs\nand\njñānīs.\nAs the supreme controller of both the material and spiritual worlds, the Lord has different incarnations of unlimited categories. Incarnations like Brahmā, Rudra, Manu, Pṛthu and Vyāsa are His material qualitative incarnations, but His incarnations like Rāma, Narasiṁha, Varāha and Vāmana are His transcendental incarnations. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of all incarnations, and He is therefore the cause of all causes."}
